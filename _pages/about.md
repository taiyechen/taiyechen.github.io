##  Welcome! 

🙋 I am an Economic PhD candidate at American University, entering the job market this year.

🗂️ My primary research interests are *international trade*, *development economics*, and *macroeconomics*. My research explores how exchange rate dynamics and global value chains impact economic development in emerging markets.Through my work with the UN and APEC, I have also developed a strong interest in geoeconomic fragmentation and debt sustainability, which I aim to further in future research

📝 I'm currently working towards my dissertation. It examines how exchange rate fluctuations and policies influence global value chain participation and resource allocation.

💡 With  experience working at international organizations, I am passionate about bridging research and policy to drive sustainable economic growth.
