  Welcome! 

🙋 I am a PhD candidate at American University, entering the job market this year.

🗂️ My primary research interests are international trade, development economics, and macroeconomics. My research explores the intersection of exchange rate dynamics, global value chains, and economic development in emerging markets.  

📝 I'm currently working towards my dissertation. It focuses on how exchange rate fluctuations and policies influence global value chain participation and resource allocation.

💡 Beyond my dissertation, I have a strong interest in geoeconomic fragmentation and debt sustainability. With  experience working at international organizations such as the UN and APEC, I am passionate about bridging research and policy to drive sustainable economic growth.
