Teaching is a vital component of my academic engagement, where I enhance studentsâ€™ analytical skills and mastery of economic and statistical concepts through interactive and practical learning experiences. As a **teaching assistant** for several graduate-level courses at American University, including Economic Theory and International Trade Theory, I have worked with students from diverse backgrounds, both in person and online, helping them navigate complex theories and quantitative methods.

In addition to my TA experience, I have served as a proctor at the Academic Support and Access Center for years. This role allowed me to support the academic development and educational goals of all students, particularly by promoting access for individuals with disabilities within our diverse university community. These experiences have reinforced my dedication to education and mentorship. I strive to create an inclusive, equal, and accessible teaching environment where learning is both rigorous and accessible to all.
