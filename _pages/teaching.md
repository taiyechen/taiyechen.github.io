Teaching is a vital component of my academic engagement, where I enhance studentsâ€™ analytical skills and mastery of economic and statistical concepts through interactive and practical learning experiences. As a **teaching assistant** for several graduate-level courses at American University, including Economic Theory and International Trade Theory, I have worked with students from diverse backgrounds, both in person and online, helping them navigate complex theories and quantitative methods.

Beyond my TA roles, my work as a proctor at the Academic Support and Access Center has strengthened my commitment to fostering inclusive learning environments. I am dedicated to ensuring that all students, including those with disabilities, can fully engage with course material. This experience has reinforced my belief in the importance of universal design for learning, providing multiple pathways for students to interact with and demonstrate their knowledge.
